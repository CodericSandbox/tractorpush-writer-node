This application is another message-publishing portion of the system described in [this Heroku Dev Center article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-realtime-polyglot-node-ruby-mongodb-socketio-app).  Instead of the original [Ruby version](https://github.com/mongolab/tractorpush-writer-ruby), [this version](https://github.com/mongolab.com/tractorpush-writer-node) uses Node.js.

Deployment instructions can be found at server web-component [here](https://github.com/mongolab/tractorpush-server).
